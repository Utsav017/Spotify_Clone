# 🎧 Spotify UI Clone

A front-end clone of the Spotify web interface built with **HTML** and **CSS**, inspired by a [lecture from Apna College](https://www.youtube.com/@ApnaCollegeOfficial). This project helped me deepen my understanding of layout techniques, styling concepts, and CSS properties.

🔗 **Live Project**: [utsav017.github.io/Spotify_Clone](https://utsav017.github.io/Spotify_Clone/)

## 🖼️ Features

- Visually similar layout to the classic Spotify desktop interface
- Clean, semantic HTML structure
- Pure CSS styling (no frameworks used)
- Smooth hover effects and clickable UI elements
- Organized file structure for easy navigation and learning

> ⚠️ Note: The clone is **not responsive** for mobile devices, but it works great on desktops, laptops, and most tablets.
